This repository contain my deep learning course assigments. Each assignment contain the Code, Report, Trained Model Weights, and other files. To run the *.py* for each assignment read the readme.txt file the relative folder.
#### Assignment 0 - Calculus for Deep Learning
##### Tasks
1. Find the critical point of following function by solving on paper as well as using SymPy python library and plot the function and the critical point on same plot.
2. Find the extreme values, critical points and the saddle points using second derivative test on paper and do the same using SymPy python Library to solve it and plot it.<br />
